## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It's designed to prevent common errors like null pointer dereferencing and data races, making it a powerful tool for writing robust software.

This repository will walk through several aspects of learning Rust, from the basics of syntax to more advanced features like memory management and concurrency.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust**: You can install Rust via `rustup` by following the instructions on [the official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
- **Cargo**: This is Rust's build system and package manager, which comes with the Rust installation.
- **Code Editor**: A Rust-friendly editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Rust extension or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with the Rust plugin.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-learning.git
cd rust-learning
